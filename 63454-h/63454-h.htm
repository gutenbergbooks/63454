<h3 id="c1">To a Monkey....
<br />Whereby This Tale Is Hung</h3>
<p>This book is dedicated to a monkey, a whimsical little fellow whose body is a sock and whose heart is hidden
somewhere in cotton stuffing. During the summer and early fall of 1955 several of our friends and readers of
Pack-O-Fun magazine wrote to us about him. We learned that instructions on how to make him could be had
from the Nelson Knitting Company of Rockford, Illinois. We received permission to reprint the instructions and
thus our new friend, the Red Heel Sock Monkey, made his appearance in the November 1955 issue of
Pack-O-Fun.</p>
<p>We expected a mild response and were quite unprepared for the deluge of mail that poured into our office
and the Nelson Knitting Company. We had no idea that so many people were interested in making a toy
monkey out of a few socks. The requests kept coming in long after our supply of this issue was exhausted
and we had to reprint the instructions as a separate folder to keep from disappointing readers all over the
country.</p>
<p>We began to think in terms of other sock toys but there were so many other things to do that the idea
was shelved for just a &ldquo;little while.&rdquo; Like so many other &ldquo;little whiles&rdquo; this one stretched into weeks and
then months. Our little friend, the Red Heel Sock Monkey, sat in lonely splendor.</p>
<p>Several months ago Michelle Graff joined our staff as an artist. Much to our delight we learned that she
was quite adept at creating and making all kinds of stuffed toys. Within a short time the Red Heel Sock
Monkey was no longer lonely. He had several friends to play with after we had turned off the lights and left
the office.</p>
<p>One of his most constant playmates was a roguish Sock Elephant. We decided to use this packed pachyderm
in some of our ads in other magazines and once again the response was greater than we had dared expect.
That settled it. We decided to change a &ldquo;little while&rdquo; into &ldquo;now&rdquo; and publish this book.</p>
<p>We have used the Nelson Red Heel socks for most of the animals, dolls, puppets and novelties in this book
for many reasons. One very good reason is that the red heel lends itself to the creation of lovable toys. The
brown body gives the feeling of warmth that a stuffed toy must have and the white ribbing and toes provide
material for faces, feet, hands, etc.</p>
<p>Another good reason is that the Nelson Red Heel socks are quite inexpensive, selling for about 30c a
pair and even less in lots of one dozen or more. These prices vary somewhat throughout the country. That
brings us to our third good reason. They are nationally sold and can be found in many variety, dry goods and
chain stores. They can also be ordered through many mail order houses.</p>
<p>All you need are some socks, scrap materials for stuffing and clothing plus a steady eye to thread a needle.
The instructions have been written as simply and made as complete as possible. Pick out your toys, thread your
needle and start. And, to make it even more fun, vary the features, the trimmings and clothes to bring out
your own creative abilities and personal touches.</p>

<h3>SOCK NO. 1</h3>
<p>Follow basic instructions on <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a> for Steps 1, 2 and
3. To shape neck and head, sew a seam tapering
from about the middle of the foot to about the middle
of the toe. (See Figure 1, above.) Then, turn sock
right side out, stuff and sew as shown in Steps 4 and
5 on <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>. This will form the neck. Do not tie, as
head is made from separate piece.</p>
<h3>SOCK NO. 2</h3>
<p><b>FORELEGS:</b> See instructions for Elephant on <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a>.
Make somewhat thinner.</p>
<p><b>HEAD:</b> Cut toe from sock (Figure 2). Turn inside
out and seam. Turn right side out and stuff. Sew to
neck (Figure 3). The head can be placed at various
angles (Figure 4). Shape nose, making it a little
longer for the donkey.</p>
<p><b>TAIL:</b> For the donkey braid a fairly thin tail from
yarn or other material with a tuft-like tip. For the
pony make the tail much fuller.</p>
<p><b>EARS:</b> For the donkey, cut two long ears from sock
(Figure 5) and two from brown felt. Sew sock and
felt pieces together, leaving an opening for turning.
Turn right side out and insert shaped pieces of wire
(Figure 6). (See <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a> for tips on wiring.) Sew
ears to head, pleating in front to curl the ears a little.
For pony, cut shorter ear pieces and omit wire.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> For nostrils, embroider two tear-shaped
patches in brown yarn. For eyes, use two
leaf-shaped pieces of black felt sewn to each side of
the head. Over each piece, sew a flat button slightly
smaller than the felt. To shape the mouth, make a
long stitch with brown yarn across the lower front
of the face and pinch sock around the mouth stitching
to form lips (Figure 7).</p>
<p><b>MANES:</b> A variety of materials can be used for
manes. Remember that the donkey&rsquo;s mane is much
thinner and stringier than a pony&rsquo;s mane. For the
donkey, strands of black yarn can be used or a piece
of black felt can be cut in a saw-tooth shape with
long teeth.</p>
<p><b>TRIM:</b> Bridles can be made from colorful leatherette.
Sew pretty buttons over pieces that are stitched
together to hide the joints (Figure 8). A short piece
of chain will serve as a bit. For the donkey, make a
colorful &ldquo;blanket&rdquo; with tasseled edges. Little packs,
made from the toes of old colored socks can be sewn
to the blanket to heighten the effect. For the pony,
make a shorter &ldquo;saddle blanket&rdquo; and add a saddle
made from an oval piece of leatherette.</p>

<p><b>NOSE:</b> Cut complete toe from sock. Stuff lightly
and sew to front of head, or sew to side to make kitty
look to the right or left (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>EARS:</b> Cut two petal-shaped ears from sock and
matching ears from pink felt. Sew one of each together,
leaving an opening for turning. Turn and
stitch to sides of head (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> For eyes, cut two oblong pieces of
white felt and sew to face. Sew little green buttons,
highlighted with specks of white, to felt. Use tempera
or white india ink for specks. Embroider nose in
pink yarn, adding three little stitches to form mouth
(Figure 3). A scrap of red felt sewn to the lower
stitch looks like a tongue (Figure 4). For whiskers,
insert broom straws or brush bristles through face
near mouth.</p>
<p><b>TRIM:</b> Use a big colorful bow with a little bell under
the chin. For an extra playful look, sew a ball of
yarn to front paws.</p>

sew to body.</p>
<p><b>EARS:</b> Cut as shown (Figure 4), seam and turn.
Sew the 2&Prime; side to the head, pleating in front a little
to incline the ears forward. Push the ears up a bit
and hold in position with a few small stitches.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> Cut two semi-circular pieces of black
felt. With curved side up, sew to face just above the
nose seam. If desired, the felt may be cut into points
to look like eyelashes. Add button or embroidered
eyes and an embroidered nose.</p>
<p><b>TRIM:</b> A gay felt collar or bright ribbon will do
much to achieve a lively look.</p>

<p>For body (Sock No. 1) follow the basic instructions
on <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a> and above.</p>
<p><b>FORELEGS:</b> Cut about 4&Prime; long, turn inside out,
seam along one side and across the foot (Figure 1).
Stuff and sew to body about &frac12;&Prime; apart. To keep arms
from sagging, insert wires while stuffing. (See <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>
for tips on wiring.)</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> For the nose, embroider a solid &ldquo;V&rdquo;
in pink yarn. Three stitches with black yarn makes
the mouth (Figure 2). Sew on bright buttons, spaced
well apart, for eyes. Add a few curved stitches in
black for curly eyelashes. Insert broom straws or
brush bristles for whiskers.</p>
<p><b>EARS:</b> Cut two petal-shaped ears, 6&Prime; long, from
sock and two from pink felt (Figure 3). Sew sock
and felt pieces together on the wrong side, leaving an
opening for turning. Double two 12&Prime; lengths of wire
into petal shapes and insert in each ear, fastening at
base of ear. Sew to sides of head with pink side forward.
Pleat the felt to incline the ears forward.</p>
<p><b>TAIL:</b> Mold a fairly large ball of cotton or use a
white yarn pom pom.</p>
<p><b>TRIM:</b> Use the prettiest bow you have and dot it
with sequins and tiny spring flowers.</p>

<p><b>FRONT LEGS:</b> See Bunny&rsquo;s front legs on <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a>.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> To make nose, pinch part of face into
a little ball and wind yarn around it. For pouchy

and baste a circle on each side of the nose and ending
just under the nose (Figure 1). Pluck stuffing into
puffs in the middle of these circles for cheeks. Tighten
stitching to hold cheeks in place. Embroider
mouth with red yarn and add small brown buttons
for eyes. Use broom straws or brush bristles for
whiskers, pushing them through sides of face.</p>
<p><b>EARS:</b> Cut two pointed ears from sock and two
from felt (Figure 2). Sew sock and felt pieces together,
leaving an opening for turning. Turn and
sew to top sides of head. Pleat felt.</p>
<p><b>TAIL:</b> Sew a thin strip of sock about 6&Prime; long. Insert
a wire and bend to shape (Figure 3). Sew to body.

<p><b>FACE:</b> Cut toe from sock, stuff and sew to head
(Figure 3). Add a red pom pom for a comical nose.
For a doleful mouth, embroider a modified upside
down V-shape and sew a lolling, long red felt tongue
underneath it (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>EARS:</b> Cut two pieces from sock and two from pink
felt (Figure 5). Sew together, leaving opening for

sew to head. Mold the front of nose into a long, blunt
shape, pushing in the point at the end. Embroider
eye-lines with brown curved lashes (Figure 2). If
possible, use crescent-shaped buttons or pieces of
brown felt for eyes to avoid the &ldquo;glazed&rdquo; look of
round buttons. Embroider mouth with brown yarn
(Figure 3).</p>

stuff and sew to body.</p>
<p><b>POUCH:</b> Cut a large triangle of knit to fit across the

Allow the pouch to sag a little to leave room
for baby kangaroo.</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 1 &middot; Fig. 2 &middot; Fig. 3</p>
</div>
<p>Make the baby kangaroo from a small child&rsquo;s sock
in a beige or other light color. Insert a cone shaped
piece of cardboard in the toe of the sock instead of
the cardboard roll used in other finger puppets. Also
for the baby kangaroo, there is no need to take a tuck
in the heel, but rather let the heel become the top of
the head (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> Turn the sock inside out and sew the
toe to a point. Turn right side, add padding in the
very tip of the toe; then insert the cone in the toe and
pad around it up to the heel. Embroider a nose and
eyelines in brown, mouth in red or pink. Add tiny
brown button eyes with a dot of white for highlight.
Add pink felt ears similar to Mama Kangaroo&rsquo;s (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>ARMS:</b> Cut a slit on each side of the sock just below
the neck. Be sure slits are large enough to fit the
fingers for manipulating the puppet. Make glove-like
fingers from the second sock or the fingers from an
old glove and sew them to the slits. Be sure not to
sew slits closed. The best way to avoid this is to turn
the puppet inside out, fit the &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; inside the slit
and whip-switch the edges together (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>TRIM:</b> Add a big baby blue bow under the chin&mdash;not
too tight. When not acting uppity like a puppet,
baby kangaroo rests comfortably in Mama Kangaroo&rsquo;s
pouch (Figure 4).</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">SCRAPPY</span></h2>
<p class="center"><b>... Our Fun-Loving, Mischievous Little Mascot!</b></p>
<p>For those who want a very special doll, we have designed
one with all the features of a bouncing,
dimpled doll right out of a toy show window. It&rsquo;s
well worth the extra time and care to make Scrappy.</p>
<p><b>BASIC DOLL:</b> Use white athletic socks and follow
the basic instructions on <a href="#Page_19">page 19</a>. For a more natural
look, quick-dip the socks in a weak, lukewarm solution
of pink dye and let dry before making the doll.</p>
<p><b>DIMPLES OR INDENTATIONS:</b> These are quite
simple to make. The trick lies in pulling a few threads
back for the indentation. Use a needle long enough
to go through the doll and thread it with yarn. Push
the needle through from the back to the point of the
indentation, catch a few of the sock threads, push
the needle back through, pull both ends of the yarn
and tie them (Figure 1). To make eye sockets, cheeks
and lip lines see Tips and Tricks, <a href="#Page_33">page 33</a>.</p>
<p><b>SHAPING BODY:</b> Knot one end of white yarn and
make three long stitches at the lower back&mdash;two
that divide the legs from the body and one that
divides the hips equally (Figure 2). Pull yarn tightly
to make indentations. Make three dimples in the
small of the back and one in the tummy.</p>
<p><b>ARMS AND LEGS:</b> Make a dimple in each elbow
and knee. Pull arms around into a natural curve,
taking a small tuck along the inside of the arm if
necessary (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> Mold the nose by pulling the stuffing
into shape and embroider or paint tiny nostrils. For
the eyes, use round buttons with shanks or salvage a
pair of eyes from an old toy. Add a spot of white
paint to each button eye. Embroider eyelashes and
eyebrows. Cut a mouth from red felt and whip stitch
to face. Then sew a white line across the middle to
divide the lips. The ears are semicircles cut from
a piece of sock. Roll the edges, hem and sew to the
head even with the eyes (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>HAIR:</b> Make colorful pom poms, using any of the
hair styles on <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>. For a short hairdo, outline
the hair line on the head before you arrange the
pom poms.</p>
<p><b>CLOTHING:</b> Scrappy can be dressed as a boy or a
girl in a wide variety of costumes. Here&rsquo;s how we
dressed &ldquo;him&rdquo; as a little boy.</p>
<p><b>SWEATER:</b> Use a colorful ribbed sock. Cut it off
at the heel and use the cuff portion. For armholes,
make a slit on each side of the sock about 1&frac12;&Prime; down
from the top. Slip sweater on and turn down the top
for a turtle neck (Figure 5).</p>
<p><b>PANTS:</b> Cut from black felt, pattern design B-2,
<a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>. Seam sides, turn and fit doll, tucking at the
waist as necessary. Add a leatherette or plaid shoe-string
belt.</p>
<p><b>JACKET:</b> Cut from bright blue felt, pattern design
A-6, <a href="#Page_28">page 28</a>. Sew side seams and turn right side
out. Sew two rows of white thread around all the
edges for trim. Add a little square pocket and tuck in
a colorful &ldquo;hankie.&rdquo; Sew small white buttons on the
front.</p>
<p><b>TAM:</b> Use bright blue felt, with the band in yellow
felt, and follow pattern design C-17 on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>. For
a snug fit, fit the yellow band around the head, sew
the ends together and use it as a guide in cutting the
circles of blue felt.</p>
<p><b>SHOES:</b> Cut from red felt, pattern design F-27, <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a>. Add shiny buckles.</p>

<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">TIPS &rsquo;N&rsquo; TRICKS</span></h2>
<p><b>SOCK SIZES:</b> The animals and dolls in this book
were made from size 13 socks; the puppets were
made from size 9 socks. The clothing pattern designs
will fit toys made from these sizes.</p>
<p><b>STUFFING:</b> We used kapok for ease in packing and
shaping. Nylon fluff, dacron filling, shredded foam
rubber or lint from an automatic dryer will work as
well. Old nylon hose and other cloth scraps tend to
become lumpy. Use a pencil or dowel for packing
stuffing in narrow places. Clean stuffed toys by dry
sudsing.</p>
<p><b>WIRING:</b> Stove pipe wire or similar types work fine.
Coat hanger wire is too thick and hard to bend. Always
bend wire ends up and in to prevent them
from working through. Wraps wires with adhesive
tape or string. Dabs of cement on the wire will hold
string in place (Figure 1). Insert wires straight and
bend the completed tail, ears and so forth.</p>

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>BEND ENDS</dt>
<dt>WRAP ENDS</dt>
<dt>ANIMAL LEGS</dt>
<dt>HUMAN LEGS</dt></dl>
<p><b>SHAPING:</b> Toys can be molded by pushing or pulling
the stuffing with the fingers. An occasional stitch
will help hold the shape. To mold chubby cheeks,
make circles of small stitches, pluck the stuffing up
in the circles, pull the ends of the thread together and
tie off (Figure 2).</p>

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>MAKING DIMPLES</dt>
<dt>GATHER CHEEKS</dt>
<dt>PULL STITCHES TO SHAPE CHEEKS</dt></dl>
<p>Indentations and dimples are made by pulling a
few sock threads back into the toy. This is done by
pushing a threaded needle through from the back,
catching a few sock threads and pushing the needle
back again. Pulling on the needle thread pulls the
sock threads in. Repeat for the desired indentations
and tie off. Figure 3 shows how this is done for eye
sockets. For toys with side eyes (bunnies, donkeys,
etc.) work from eye to eye. For more natural lip
lines, catch several sock threads in shallow arcs over
and under the lips and in a straight line between the
lips (Figure 4). See Scrappy on <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a> for ideas on
where to put dimples. Use a darning needle to push
through the head or body. Lightly pencilled guide
lines are helpful.</p>

<p><b>FEATURES:</b> To give the face a flesh colored look,
dip the toe of the sock in a weak solution of pink
dye before the sock is cut and stuffed. Be sure the
solution is lukewarm. For a more professional look,
sew flesh colored stockinet over the face after the
features have been molded and stitched into shape
(Figure 5).</p>

<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>MOLD FEATURES BY PINCHING AND STITCHING</dt>
<dt>THEN SEW STOCKINET TIGHTLY OVER FACE WITHOUT FLATTENING</dt></dl>
<p><b>EYES:</b> If you plan to make several toys, especially
animals, invest in manufactured eyes. Or, use eyes
from discarded toys. Shoe buttons also make very
good eyes since they have shanks. Add a highlight
speck of white paint to each button eye to avoid that
blank look. Never use eyes that are too small unless
you want an older or mean look.</p>
<p><b>HAIR:</b> Inexpensive wigs, or ones from discarded
dolls, can be substituted for pom poms and scrap fur.
Pencil guide lines on the head before sewing on pom
poms.</p>
<p><b>FACIAL EXPRESSIONS:</b> Much can be done to accentuate
features and to give toys individuality by
embroidering or using felt eyebrows, eyelashes,
wrinkles, crinkles and so forth. Felt pieces should
be glued on or sewn with tiny stitches in matching
thread. We used the satin stitch for embroidered
features (Figure 6).</p>

<dt>SATIN STITCH EYE</dt></dl>
<p><b>CLOTHING:</b> Use freshly laundered and pressed materials&mdash;it&rsquo;s
well worth the extra effort. Avoid patterned
materials that are out of proportion to the
toys. Crayons (pressed well into the fabric) or textile
paints can be used to make small pattern designs.
Tempera paints tend to wash out. Choose materials
that do not easily unravel.</p>

</div>
<p><b>MAKING AND STUFFING HEAD:</b> Insert a short
piece of paper towel roll in the toe of the sock, then
push stuffing up around it until the head is plump
and round (Figure 1). Tie a ribbon around the neck
and stitch in place to keep it from slipping (Figure 2).
Features can be added and the face pushed into
various shapes. The finger puppets on pages <a href="#Page_35">35</a>-38
are just a few of the endless variations that can be
made.</p>
<p><b>ARMS:</b> Make a slit on each side of the sock below
the neck&mdash;just large enough for your thumb and
little finger. If desired, little glove-like fingers can be
sewn over the openings, otherwise just whip stitch
the edge (Figure 3). Add appropriate clothes.</p>
<p><b>TO OPERATE:</b> Push your index finger and second
finger into the cardboard roll; and thumb and little
finger into the slits on the side (Figure 4). Head can
be bobbed up and down or sideways by moving the
fingers inside the cardboard roll while the thumb and
little finger can move together and apart to grasp
articles, wave, and so on.</p>

<p><b>NOSE:</b> Use the red heel of another sock or a piece of
felt. Cut in a triangular shape, sew the long sides
together, turn and stuff lightly. Bend for a hooked
nose and sew to face (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>MOUTH:</b> Sew on an upside down crescent-shaped
piece of felt.</p>
<p><b>EYES:</b> Sew on two black buttons, close together
over nose. Embroider forbidding black eyebrows.</p>
<p><b>HAIR:</b> Add scraggly black hair by sewing on loops
of black yarn in various lengths and cutting the ends
open (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>CLOAK:</b> Use a piece of dark material about 12&Prime; &times;
15&Prime;. Fold in half lengthwise. Sew across one end
starting at the corner of the folded edge and tapering
down to a point 2&Prime; from the top of the open edge
(Figure 3). The highest point becomes the peak of
the hood. Turn right side out. Gather the material
about 4&Prime; down from the front of the hood to fit
around the neck of the puppet. Stitch ribbon over
gathers and tie ends at front. Turn front edges of
hood back about 1&Prime; and hem rough edges (Figure 4).</p>

<p><b>LEGS:</b> Cut the white ribbings from two socks to
make the legs. Cut each ribbing lengthwise and sew
down the long sides and across one end. Turn and
stuff lightly. Sew the legs to the front of the puppet
sock opposite the heel so that the puppet appears to
&ldquo;sit&rdquo; when propped over the edge of a stage. Tie
ribbon around the ankles (Figure 1). For more realistic
legs with feet, follow methods used for dolls on
pages <a href="#Page_17">17</a> and <a href="#Page_19">19</a>.</p>
<p><b>HAIR:</b> See <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a> for hair styles. Make both from
the same color yarn.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES:</b> Embroider eyelashes and eyebrows in
black yarn. Mouths are red felt. Sew an upturned
nose with beige yarn (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>BLOUSE:</b> Cut Katie&rsquo;s blouse from two pieces of
white material (Figure 3). Sew together at shoulders,
leaving a space for neck and then down sides
leaving arm holes. Pull up over bottom of puppet.
Add a wide lace collar to hide shoulder seams and
short lace edging around arm holes.</p>
<p><b>SKIRT:</b> Cut a 10&Prime; circle of felt and remove a 3&Prime; circle
from the center. Slit up the back and overlap to
fit around the puppet. Fasten with a snap. Add
shoulder straps of the same material to keep the
skirt from slipping. Trim the skirt and straps with
embroidery or sequins (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>SHIRT:</b> Cut Jamie&rsquo;s shirt from the same white material
and stitch to the body in the same way. Cut a
collar-shaped piece of material and stitch around the
neck. Whip stitch arm holes. Add buttons down
front of shirt (Figure 5).</p>
<p><b>PANTS:</b> Cut the pants as shown from the same felt
material as the skirt&mdash;pointed piece for the front
(Figure 6). Sew the point down onto the sock between
the legs. Back piece will actually look like a
skirt and is merely there to make short pants appear
complete. Make suspenders from the same material
and attach to the pants with tiny buttons.</p>
<p><b>HATS:</b> For Katie, make a bonnet as shown and tie to
the head with ribbon bow under chin (Figure 7).
Jamie wears a beanie made from the toe of a sock.
Roll back the brim and add a pom pom to the top
(Figure 8).</p>
<p><b>SHOES:</b> If you use more elaborate legs with feet,
follow the shoe pattern designs on <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a> making
about &frac12; size. Remember to sew the shoes to the feet
rather than try to fit shoes over feet.</p>

<p><b>NOSE AND EYES:</b> Pinch a small portion of the sock
together in the middle of the face and tie off&mdash;dab
with red paint. Sew on one button eye and make a
black patch for the other. Make evil looking black
eyebrows from yarn (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>MOUTH:</b> From red felt, cut a wide, sly, grinning
mouth. Remove a small portion from the center to
give an open grin. Add a gruesome tooth or two and
a villainous black mustache (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>BEARD:</b> Add yarn or fringed felt around the chin
and sides of the face. At the top of the beard, add a
few longer strands of wild looking hair (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>DRESS:</b> Make a bandana from bright spotted material
and tie it around the top of the head, knotting
the ends at one side. Hang brass curtain rings on for
earrings. For the shirt, take a black colored sock
and cut it off at the heel. For arm holes, make a slit
on each about 1&Prime; down from the top of the cuff. Slip
over the puppet and turn down top for a turtle neck
effect. Add a belt from leatherette and paint the
skull and cross bones in the center (Figure 4).</p>

nose (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>HAIR:</b> Wind black yarn around a card 3&Prime; wide,
about 20 times. Gather along one edge with black
yarn; snip other edge open and remove carefully
(Figure 2). Sew to the top of the head with the seam
down the center like a part and hair hanging down
each side of the head. Fit a band of tape (embroidered
or plain with beadwork) around the head
and add a feather at the back (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>DRESS:</b> Cut a shirt from a piece of material 8&Prime; &times; 6&Prime;,
seam and fit to puppet with opening at the back.
Gather along the waist and sew to a strip of felt for
the belt (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>OPTIONAL:</b> Add novel beads around neck and
wrists (if you have added the glove-like fingers
mentioned in the basic instructions). You might try
a Mohawk hairdo, braids, fancy headdress, medicine

<p><b>EARS</b>: Cut two petal shaped pieces from brown felt
or scrap fur and two pieces from pink felt. Sew the
pink and brown pieces together, leaving an opening
for turning. Turn and stitch to head. Pleat felt.</p>
<p><b>MANE</b>: Sew bushy yarn pom poms (see <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>) or
strips of scrap fur over the top of the head and down
around the neck (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>PAWS</b>: Make two small paws from the second sock
or the fingers of an old glove and sew over the slits
at the sides of the puppet. Add small yarn pom poms
or fur scraps near the ends (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>FINISHING TOUCHES</b>: If he is to be THE LION
in &ldquo;The Wizard of Oz&rdquo; hang a little heart locket
around the neck.</p>

</div>
<p>Follow the basic instruction for the finger puppets
on <a href="#Page_35">page 35</a>.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: Cut toe from second sock, turn inside
out and sew to a narrower end (Figure 1). Turn,
stuff and stitch to the face. Embroider two nostrils at
the tip and sew on a red mouth. Cut two circles of
brown felt and sew to each side of the head. Add
bright buttons or beads to complete the eyes. For a
sleepy look, use flat button eyes and sew crescent-shaped
pieces of felt over so that only the bottom
half of the eyes shows. Embroider eyelashes, or cut
them from felt, if you want to give Mr. Billy Goat a
coy expression.</p>
<p><b>EARS AND HORNS</b>: Cut ears as shown and sew to
the top of the head (Figure 2). Make horns from
white felt, sewing them into a tube. Insert pipe
cleaners into the tubes so that they can be bent to
the desired shape. Sew firmly to the top of the head,
pushing pipe cleaners down into the head a bit.
Curve horns backwards (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>WHISKERS</b>: Add a pom pom (wound only 10 times)
under the chin and trim to a point.</p>
<p><b>TRIM</b>: Add a high, formal white collar with a black
bow tie. Make a pair of spectacles from thin wire
with the nose piece setting well towards the tip (Figure 4).</p>

<p>The puppets shown on the following pages are basically
those in which the mouth is made to move by the
action of the hand. In making these puppets keep in
mind that ample room must be left over and under
the mouth piece for the fingers to operate freely to
obtain the maximum facial expressions. Do not use
staples, pins or other sharp objects to hold pieces together
since they are apt to cut the hand or fingers.
Make the puppets large enough so that they can be
easily slipped on and off by the child or adult using
them.</p>
<p><b>STEP NO. 1</b>: Tuck the heel of the sock to make a
straight tubular piece.</p>
<p><b>STEP NO. 2</b>: Cut the foot of the sock as shown by
the dotted lines.</p>
<p><b>STEP NO. 3</b>: Turn the sock inside out and cut a
piece of red material the shape of the mouth opening.
Also cut a matching piece from cardboard. Sew
the red material to the sock with an overhand stitch
or use your sewing machine.</p>
<p><b>STEP NO. 4</b>: Turn the sock right side out. Fold the
cardboard piece in half and insert in the sock.</p>
<p><b>STEP NO. 5</b>: Add features such as button eyes, nose,
hair and so forth.</p>
<p><b>ANIMATION</b>: Most talking puppets are operated by
placing the thumb under the bottom cardboard piece
and the fingers over the upper piece. Open and close
the hand to make the puppet talk. Twisting the hand
will give a variety of facial expressions and moving
the arm about will add to the illusion.</p>
<h2><span class="small">VARIATIONS</span></h2>
<div class="img">

</div>
<p>The basic instructions above are for the crocodile
which appeared in the September 1954 issue of <i>Pack-O-Fun</i>
magazine. With modifications, literally hundreds
of puppet variations can be made. By simply
adding a saw-toothed strip of felt on top, Mr. Crocodile
can be turned into a scaly, scary dragon. Or by
shortening the mouth and building up the head, as
we did for the clown and ringmaster on page 40, you
can create a multitude of lovable characters from
Hansel and Gretel to modern animated cartoon
animals.</p>
<p>Whiskers and mustaches will give villainous or
rube-like looks; eyes and ears can be exaggerated for
comic expressions; cheeks can be padded for a
chubby look and noses can be anything from a tiny
button to a long duck&rsquo;s beak. Hairdos can be long
and feminine, short and boyish or fringed for a lion&rsquo;s
mane. Hats, dresses and other costume pieces will
enhance the puppet character and hide the arm.</p>
<p>The puppets on pages <a href="#Page_42">42</a>-43 were made for the
underwater western skit &ldquo;Phineas Rides Again&rdquo;
written by our Katie Conrad. Four of the characters
are talking puppets. Louie the Lobster is a finger
puppet and will give you an idea how both types of
puppets can be combined for maximum visual effect.
Susie Starfish has no moving parts, but being
the beautiful heroine really doesn&rsquo;t need any! It is
possible for one person to handle all six roles.</p>

</div>
<p>For Sock No. 1 follow Steps 1, 2, 3, 4 on <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>, but
make the mouth shorter.</p>
<p><b>HEAD</b>: Cut 4&Prime; from the toe of the second sock. Stuff
lightly, but firmly, so that it doesn&rsquo;t get too heavy
(Figure 1). Sew to the top of the first sock, turning
under the rough edges. Be careful not to sew the
space above the cardboard closed in Sock No. 1.
Shape nice and round (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: For eyes use large round or crescent-shaped
pieces of felt with bright buttons sewn on.
Embroider exaggerated eyebrows. Use a big bead
or button for the nose. Colorful pom poms (see
<a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>) are sewn on for sideburns. Cut a piece of
bright red felt for an upper lip and sew it to the top
sock (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>COSTUME</b>: Add a cone-shaped hat (see Clown Doll
on <a href="#Page_27">page 27</a>) perched at a rakish angle. To hide the
arm, stitch a colorful ruffle around the neck&mdash;being
careful not to sew it so tight that you will have
difficulty getting your arm in the puppet (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>ANIMATION</b>: Slip the thumb into the bottom part
of the mouth and the fingers into the top.</p>
<h2><span class="small">RINGMASTER</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig116">

<p class="pcap">Fig. 1 &middot; Fig. 2 &middot; Fig. 3 &middot; Fig. 4</p>
</div>
<p>Make the head the same way as the clown above.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: The ringmaster&rsquo;s features are more
nearly natural than those of the clown. Embroider
thick eyebrows in black, brown or red yarn and sew
buttons under them for eyes. For the nose cut a triangular
piece from a matching sock, sew the long
edges together and turn. Stuff lightly and sew to
face. Bend the nose to give it a slight hook (Figure 1).
The curling mustache, hair and neat sideburns
can be embroidered in yarn matching or contrasting
with the eyebrows (Figure 2). Ears can be cut from
felt. Sew them on so that they stick out a bit.</p>
<p><b>COSTUME</b>: Use shiny black oilcloth to make the top
hat described on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>. Set at a jaunty angle and
whip stitch to head. Stitch a white wing collar around
the neck with just the suggestion of a tie (Figure 3).
For greater realism add the upper part of a frock
coat with wide lapels. Put a white carnation on the
right lapel (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>OTHER CIRCUS PUPPETS</b>: By following the basic
head patterns you can make other circus folk and
animals. For features use the many suggestions for
the Sock Animals and Sock Dolls. For example, for
a talking elephant stitch a trunk right above the
mouth, add tusks and big ears, a tasseled headpiece
and so forth.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Announcer</span>: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!
For years the action-filled western has reigned supreme
as a favorite with adventure story lovers. Recently,
however, its popularity has been challenged by a rush
of interest in underwater drama. Tonight, we combine
these trends and proudly present a production that will
please everyone: A-Cowboy-Story-Under-The-Sea. Its
title is &ldquo;Phineas Rides Again&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Foam Ranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following exciting characters will appear:</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sheriff</span>: Sorry, Finny. I haven&rsquo;t been so excited since
my dogfish had guppies.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: Clem told me about the robbery. Have you
found the varmints yet?</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sheriff</span>: Nope. They left a red herring on the trail.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: Hm. Must have been some daring soles.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sheriff</span>: Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Only an &rsquo;eel would do a
thing like that.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: I&rsquo;ll go get my sea horse from the coral and
join the posse.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sheriff</span>: Fine. See you later. (<i>SHERIFF leaves. Before

<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: Oh, I&rsquo;m so frightened! Please help me, Phineas.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: Stop your blubberin&rsquo;, little gal. What&rsquo;s
wrong?</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: (<i>weeping</i>) I can&rsquo;t find the Sheriff! I think I
know who robbed the bank, and they&rsquo;re after me!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: Who, gal, who?</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: Oily Oliver Octopus and Louie the Lobster!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: Are you sure? Why I remember them when
they were just a couple of perch-snatchers.</p>

but I didn&rsquo;t realize what they were going to do.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: I&rsquo;ll go tell the Sheriff. He&rsquo;ll throw out the
fishnet.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: (<i>wailing</i>) Oh, don&rsquo;t leave me! Stur-geon-na be
trouble.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: Don&rsquo;t you fret, Susie, gal. Hide behind that
clump of seagrass till I come back. (<i>PHINEAS leaves,
RIGHT. SUSIE also leaves, LEFT, apparently to hide.

<p><span class="sc">Oliver</span>: Well, we made our get-away all right.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Louie</span>: Yep, but I&rsquo;m scared, boss. We&rsquo;ve got to catch
that little starfish before she talks.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Oliver</span>: Well, where is she? She came this way.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Louie</span>: &rsquo;Course I kinda hate to hurt her. Gosh, she&rsquo;s

<p><span class="sc">Oliver</span>: Forget it! Don&rsquo;t be a sucker for a pretty fish.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Louie</span>: Reckon you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;ll go look that-a-way.

her on stage from left.</i>) Aho! So there you are. Come
on out.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: I was right! It WAS you and Louie.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Oliver</span>: Yes, but you&rsquo;ll never tell.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: Unhand me, you cod! Somebody else already
knows!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Oliver</span>: Who?</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: I won&rsquo;t tell!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Oliver</span>: Talk, you little sprat!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: I won&rsquo;t! I won&rsquo;t!</p>
<p><span class="sc">Oliver</span>: So you&rsquo;re gonna clam up? Wait&rsquo;ll I get Louie!
(<i>OLIVER leaves, and SUSIE is alone.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Susie</span>: (<i>wailing</i>) Land o&rsquo;Ocean, what shall I do?
(<i>PHINEAS enters, RIGHT.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: I&rsquo;ll save you, Susie gal! Go hide again,

<p><span class="sc">Phineas</span>: I&rsquo;ll fix you, you lobster mobster! (<i>PHINEAS

6&Prime; from tip to tip. Round the points for a soft look.
For hair, cut a heart-shaped piece of black, yellow or
red felt. Sew to star face with matching thread. Add
eyebrows, long inverted coy eyelashes, two stitches
to suggest a nose and a red rosebud mouth (Figure 1).
Sew the star-face to the sole of the sock (Figure 2).</p>

pink or red felt, fold and overstitch around mouth
slit (Figure 1). Turn sock right side out and add a
thin lip line. For the fan-shaped tail, cut strip of burlap
or felt and sew to sock cuff, pleating slightly. Be
careful not to sew cuff together. Hide the rough cut
edges with a band of felt. (Figure 2). Add fins and
bright colored gills. Button eyes and a few accents of
paint will provide realism. Add a cowboy hat (see
<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>) and tie or stitch to head (Figure 3). To
animate Phineas, slip two fingers above the mouth
and two fingers under the mouth. Open and close
scissors-fashion.</p>
<p>Remember to sew a tuck in the heels to make
straight tubular socks. Puppets are made for either
hand and stage directions can be reversed. Dye
white socks if colored socks are not available.</p>

For the mouth, cut a clam-shaped piece of pink
felt and matching piece from stiff cardboard (Figure 2).
Follow the basic instructions on <a href="#Page_39">page 39</a>, stretching
the sock to fit the shape of the mouth pieces. Sew
on big, bright blue button eyes, add a short, colored
felt beard under the chin and paint black, clam-like
streaks on top of the head (Figure 3). Make a cowboy
hat (see <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>) and stitch to head. Operate

separate pieces for the top and bottom because dry
cellulose sponge is not very pliable (Figure 1). Embroider
a mustache, long hair and sideburns in dark
green yarn. Sew on big yellow button eyes. Add a
cowboy hat (see <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a> for hats) with a silver star

<p>A black sock is a must for this black hearted villain.
Make the same way as the clown on <a href="#Page_40">page 40</a>, only
with a much smaller mouth. Cut two half-crescents
from white felt, sew on head and add small button
eyes (Figure 1). For tentacles, cut eight triangular
pieces of material, about 6&Prime; long and 2&Prime; at the base.
Sew the long sides together, stuff lightly and stitch
to body with seams on the bottom (Figure 2). Make
a stovepipe hat, following hat principles on <a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>,

<p><b>BODY</b>: Use cut foot portion from white sock, or if
you wish a larger penguin, take a tuck in the heel
making a long tubular piece. Stuff toe lightly for
head and heavier toward the opening which will be
the base of the penguin. Sew opening closed. Tie off
at the neck with a formal black bow-tie (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>WINGS</b>: From black material, felt or oilcloth, cut
two pieces for each wing as shown. Seam, turn and
insert a piece of cardboard the same size and shape.
Sew on just below the neck (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>FEET</b>: Cut two webbed feet from black material and
two from cardboard. Sew or glue one of each together
and fasten to the base of the penguin (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: Sew a tiny white button onto a small
circle of black felt for each eye. Make a cone-shaped
beak from yellow felt. Draw a line along each side
to indicate the mouth and sew to the front of the
head (Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>PENGUIN FAMILY</b>: Make Mrs. Penguin slightly
smaller, and Junior about two-thirds size. Mr. Penguin
will, of course, wear a top hat (<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>) while
Mrs. Penguin may have to be content with pattern
design <a href="#Page_31">E-19</a>. A colorful apron might mollify her
feelings though. Junior can wear a top hat or, since
he&rsquo;s a bit young, a beanie.</p>

<p><b>BODY</b>: Use foot from light colored sock. Stuff
plump and round. Sew up opening in the bottom.
Tie off about one-third the way down for the head.
Add a stiff-necked white collar with the tabs turned
back around the neck (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>WINGS</b>: From stiff material of the same color, cut
two wings as shown. Sew one to each side of the
body with tip of the wings extending down and out
at the bottom to form the tail (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>FEET</b>: Cut two webbed feet from cardboard and two
from stiff material. Sew one of each together and
fasten to the bottom of the duck (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: Sew a round black button onto a large
circle of white felt for each eye. Make the beak from
two pieces of felt and sew to the front of the face
(Figure 4).</p>
<p><b>OPTIONAL</b>: If you want to make a sailor out of
your duck, add a sailor hat perched at an angle on
the top of his head and the regular sailor&rsquo;s collar and
neckerchief. To make the collar, use a rectangle of
blue material, cut a deep arc from one corner to the
other, then overlap corners at the front. Embroider
or paint 3 white stripes along the three outside edges&mdash;add
neckerchief. The hat is made from the ribbed
end of a sock. Cut off the cuff, gather rough edge together
tightly and turn back the other edge about 1&Prime;.
If you prefer a stiff brim, insert a piece of cardboard
around the inside of the turned back section.</p>

<h2 id="c37"><span class="small">DOUBLE DOLL</span></h2>
<p>There are any number of combinations that you
might like to try for your double doll, such as Peppy
and Sleepy, Suzy and Sammy or a couple of clowns.
We have chosen Happy and Dumpy.</p>
<p><b>BODY</b>: Take a tuck in the heel of the sock so that
you have a straight tubular sock. Cut off the cuff.
Stuff plumply and firmly and sew opening closed.
Tie off the middle to divide the sock into two dolls;
then tie off the head about half way down from each
end (Figure 1). Do not tie tightly or doll will be too
wobbly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig125">
<img src="images/p24.jpg" alt="" width="472" height="369" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 1</p>
</div>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: The big differences in these two dolls
are the features which are exactly the opposite. Both
faces have the same type of nose made by pulling a
piece of the face into a ball or lump and then tying
off with yarn or thread. The eyebrows are embroidered
in black yarn. Happy&rsquo;s eyebrows are
curved in a convex manner while Dumpy&rsquo;s are concave.
Use large bright buttons for eyes, centering
them under the eyebrows. Embroider a few tears
running from Dumpy&rsquo;s eyes. Dumpy has a turned
down mouth made of red felt while Happy&rsquo;s mouth is
turned up in a big grin. Cut the two mouths identically
and merely reverse the points. A few frown
lines can be embroidered with brown yarn on
Dumpy&rsquo;s forehead (Figure 2).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig126">
<img src="images/p24a.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="287" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 2</p>
</div>
<p><b>HAIR</b>: Make the hair from pom poms, choosing a
style from <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>. Happy and Dumpy can be either
boys or girls or one of each. Make Happy&rsquo;s hair from
yellow or red pom poms; Dumpy&rsquo;s from black or
brown. Set Dumpy&rsquo;s hair lower on the head to accentuate
the frowning look. If one or both heads are
boys, add ears of semicircular felt to the sides of
the head.</p>
<p><b>ARMS AND LEGS</b>: Actually these are one and the
same. The legs of one doll serve as the arms of the
other and vice-versa. Make them from a second sock.
Cut out four rectangles about twice the length of the
head. Sew the long edges together and across one
end. Turn and stuff lightly. Sew to the shoulders so
that they hang freely. When the doll is flipped over,
one pair should flop to the sides for arms while the
other pair hangs down for the legs (Figure 3). Tie
ribbon around the wrist/ankles.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig127">
<img src="images/p24c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="605" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 3</p>
</div>
<p><b>DRESS</b>: Make a wide flaring skirt from a pattern
design on <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>. For greater contrast sew two different
colored pieces together so that when the doll
is flipped over a different colored skirt will appear.
Add blouses, bows, hats or any other bits that you
think will make the dolls look cuter.</p>

<h2 id="c38"><span class="small">OWL PILLOW</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig128">
<img src="images/p24f.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="611" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 1 &middot; Fig. 2 &middot; Fig. 3 &middot; Fig. 4</p>
</div>
<p><b>BODY</b>: Use foot of a large, dark sock. Stuff firmly,
but flatten it as you do. Sew opening closed. With
yarn, tie off the head about one-third of the way
down.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: Sew two white felt circles fairly close
together and in the middle of each sew small yellow
buttons for the eyes. Make a small cone-shaped beak
from shiny oilcloth and sew on just below the eyes
so that eyes and nose form a triangle. Accent this
triangle by embroidering a &ldquo;V&rdquo; just above the eyes
and nose (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>EARS</b>: Cut four pieces as shown from the rest of the
sock. Sew two together for each ear, turn and stitch
to top of head, pleating the front half slightly (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>WINGS</b>: Cut two wings from matching felt and sew
one on each side of owl. Accent with lines of white
for feathers (Figure 3). To finish the owl, embroider
or paint wavy lines on the body between the two
wings. Also embroider claws at the bottom, curving
them as if clinging to a branch of a tree. Finally add
a big red bow at the neck (Figure 4). If you prefer
a stuffed doll, stuff it round and plump and then add
felt feet at the bottom.</p>
<h2><span class="small">HUMPTY DUMPTY</span></h2>
<div class="img" id="fig129">
<img src="images/p24g.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="602" />
<p class="pcap">Fig. 1 &middot; Fig. 2 &middot; Fig. 3 &middot; Fig. 4</p>
</div>
<p><b>BODY</b>: Use cut foot portion from sock. Round open
edges. Stuff firmly and sew opening closed. Push
stuffing around until you have a nice egg shape.</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: For eyes, sew two small circles of black
felt over two large half-circles of white felt. The
black eye pieces can be placed in the center, to the
sides or cross-eyed to get different effects. Add eyebrows
of black felt or embroider them in black yarn.
A few stitches in brown yarn will serve for a nose.
Cut the mouth from red felt (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>ARMS AND LEGS</b>: Make two arms and legs from
the second sock. Cut rectangular pieces, sew along
the long sides and across one end. Turn and stuff.
Sew the arms to the sides of the body and the legs to
the bottom. The longer the arms and legs are, the
cuter your doll will be. Tie yarn or ribbon around
wrists and ankles.</p>
<p><b>HAIR</b>: Make yarn pom poms (see <a href="#Page_32">page 32</a>) and sew
them to the top of the head.</p>
<p><b>DRESS</b>: From the pattern designs on <a href="#Page_29">page 29</a>, make
a pair of pants and tack them on Humpty Dumpty. A
colorful cap can be made from pattern designs on
<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>. If you decide to make shoes (<a href="#Page_30">page 30</a>) bend
the legs for feet, stitching the tuck.</p>

<p>Make your Weenie Doll from a dark sock so that his
features really show up.</p>
<p><b>BODY</b>: Use cut foot portion from sock. Stuff firmly
and sew opening closed. Tie off one-third the length
for the head (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: Cut two ovals of white felt and two
smaller ones of black. Sew or glue the smaller ones
to the larger and sew them on the face for the eyes.
Embroider eyelashes and eyebrows in black. Make a
circle of red felt with a stitch across the center for the
mouth. Embroider a few lines in the center of the
face for the nose (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>EARS</b>: Cut two petal-shaped ears. Roll outer edges,
hem and sew to side of head at eye level (Figure 3).</p>
<p><b>ARMS AND FEET</b>: Cut two arms from white felt
and two from cardboard. Sew one of each together,
making sure you have one for the right and one for
the left side of the body. Stitch to body (Figure 4).
Cut two feet from black felt and two from cardboard.
Sew one of each together and fasten to the bottom of
the doll. Add buckles or bow to the toes (Figure 5).</p>
<p><b>CAP</b>: Cut about 3&Prime; from the ribbing of the sock.
Gather cut edge together tightly. Place cap on head,
tying a band around the cap about 1&Prime; down from the
gathers and adding a pom pom at the top (Figure 6).</p>

<p class="pcap">Fig. 1 &middot; Fig. 2 &middot; Fig. 3 &middot; Fig. 4</p>
</div>
<p><b>MOUTH</b>: Cut an oval of cardboard 3&Prime; &times; 4&Prime; and insert
it in the toe of the sock. Stitch the toe of the sock
to the edges of the cardboard to give the mouth
shape. Embroider brown ovals, just above the mouth
for the nostrils. Stuff toe firmly down to the heel of
the sock (Figure 1).</p>
<p><b>FEATURES</b>: Make eyes from tear-drop shaped
pieces of black felt with tiny brown buttons in the
center. With paint add a highlight of white in the
center of each eye. Cut two ears from brown felt or
leatherette. Fold in half and sew to the top of the
head. Add a mane made from fringe or loops of yarn.
Start at the top of the head over the eyes, go between
the ears and down the back of the horse (Figure 2).</p>
<p><b>RIDING STICK</b>: Push a broomstick into the sock
up to the heel. Pad well all around the broomstick
down to the cuff of the sock (Figure 3). Tie off tightly.
Add a halter made from leatherette or oilcloth,
carrying the reins to the back of the horse&rsquo;s neck.
Add festive pom poms and jingle bells (Figure 4).</p>
